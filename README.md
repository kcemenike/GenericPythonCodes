# GenericPythonCodes
This is just a repo of generic python codes, mostly housed in iPython notebooks.

# Prerequisite(s)
I shall do as much as I can to insert all required modules as import statements on the first line of the notebook. They are mostly popularly known modules - if you get any error while trying to run this first line, just run:
pip install [module] without the square braces
